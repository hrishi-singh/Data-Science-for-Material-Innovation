# Data-Science-for-Material-Innovation
Design / Practical Experience Project, under the guidance of Dr. Deepak Arora sir, Associate Professor, IIT Jodhpur.To reduce the time‑to‑market and the development cost of new polymer products, Data Science is applied to pre‑ pared Data sets based on the idea of training machine learning algorithms on large databases to predict polymer Density.
